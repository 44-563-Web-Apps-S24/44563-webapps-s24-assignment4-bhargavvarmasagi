    <h1>Venkata Srinivasa Bhargav Varma Sagi does Chekov tonight</h1>
    <h2>ON THE HIGH ROAD - Anton Chekov</h2>

    <h4>EFIMOVNA.</h4>
    <p>
      <p>[To NAZAROVNA]</p> Give the old man a nudge dear! Can't get any answer out of
      him.
    </p>

    <h4>NAZAROVNA.</h4>
    <p>
      <p>[Lifting the corner of a cloth covering of SAVVA'S face]</p> Are you alive or
      are you dead, you holy man?
    </p>

    <h4>SAVVA.</h4>
    <p>
      Why should I be dead? I'm alive, mother! <p>[Raises himself on his elbow]</p>
      Cover up my feet, there's a saint! That's it. A bit more on the right one.
      That's it, mother. God be good to us.,
    </p>

    <h4>NAZAROVNA.</h4>
    <p><p>[Wrapping up SAVVA'S feet]</p> Sleep, little father.</p>

    <h4>SAVVA.</h4>
    <p>
      What sleep can I have? If only I had the patience to endure this pain,
      mother; sleep's quite another matter. A sinner doesn't deserve to be given
      rest. What's that noise, pilgrim-woman?
    </p>

    <h4>NAZAROVNA.</h4>
    <p>
      God is sending a storm. The wind is wailing, and the rain is pouring down,
      pouring down. All down the roof and into the windows like dried peas. Do
      you hear? The windows of heaven are opened... <p>[Thunder]</p> Holy, holy,
      holy...
    </p>

    <h4>FEDYA.</h4>
    <p>
      And it roars and thunders, and rages, sad there's no end to it! Hoooo...
      it's like the noise of a forest.... Hoooo.... The wind is wailing like a
      dog.... <p>[Shrinking back]</p> It's cold! My clothes are wet, it's all coming in
      through the open door... you might put me through a wringer.... <p>[Plays
        softly]</p> My concertina's damp, and so there's no music for you, my Orthodox
      brethren, or else I'd give you such a concert, my word!--Something
      marvellous! You can have a quadrille, or a polka, if you like, or some
      Russian dance for two.... I can do them all. In the town, where I was an
      attendant at the Grand Hotel, I couldn't make any money, but I did wonders
      on my concertina. And, I can play the guitar.
